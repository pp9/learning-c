### Chapter 1
__Prefix notation__ - (*polish notation*) when operator is placed before arguments `+ 3 4`

__substitution model__ - ?

__normal order evaluation__ - full substitution, then reduction

__applicative-order evaluation__ - first argument calculation, then basic calculation

### 1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates
* __case analysis__ - construction for analyze cases (whole construction)
* __clauses__ - cases in case analysis `if(some > 10 || some < 10)`
* __predicate__ - exp which treated as `true` or `false`
* __consequent expressions__ - `true` predicate value
* __predicate__ - expression which value t or f `if(predicate)`

### 1.1.7


## 1.3 Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures
+ __higher-order procedure__

### 1.3.2 Constructing Procedures Using _Lambda_
+ __lambda__ - procedure without name `(lambda (x) (+ x 4))`
+ __let__ - local scope variables in let body

### 1.3.3 Procedures as General Methods
+ half-interval method
+ fixed point

### 1.3.4 Procedures as Returned Values
+ first-class procedures
    + They may be named by variables.
    + They may be passed as arguments to procedures.
    + They may be returned as the results of procedures.
    + They may be included in data structures.
